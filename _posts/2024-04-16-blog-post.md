The resolution of delay and doppler in OTFS' DD frame can be understood in the from of DFT, where the frequency resolution is 1 divided by frame duration, vice versa. 

As the frequency axis (TF domain) coresponds to the delay axis, the TF domain frequency resolution $\delta f$ is equal to  1/Duration, so the duration of Delay is 
$$\frac{1}{\delta f}$$

, and the resolution of Delay is Duraion divdied by M ($\frac{1}{\delta f}$).
